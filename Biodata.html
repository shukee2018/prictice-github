	<h1>Ibrahim T</h1>
	<p> <strong>July</strong>, 2013 I graduated from <strong>Jimma university</strong> with a BA degree by accounting when I was back home. Throughout my child hood, my passion has always been assisting the people who have the problem with the new information technology like me. In fact the country where come from is very back word by technology. For this reason, my strong goal is graduated from college help marginalized community; particularly in Ethiopia. I believe that; the future is shaped by depending on our current thought. This is the prospective I believe in and practice in my life. Therefore my future is already set in my mind and it is to graduate from college. The only thing remains is to be done is to set free future in to the real life.
